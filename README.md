# Building-Metabolic-Syndrome-Predictor-Model-with-Catboost

This is our final project for the subject COSC-E4 (Machine Learning). We used the dataset that came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
We built the model in order to predict whether the person has a Metabolic Syndrome based on the risk factors, which is given in the dataset. 
In this project we used Jupyter Notebook/ Python in order to build a model. We also used the external library **Catboost**, it is a machine learning algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees, it has a high quality and fast learning process. 

For installing Catboost using the PIP command: https://catboost.ai/en/docs/installation/python-installation-method-pip-install <br/>
using conda install: https://catboost.ai/en/docs/installation/python-installation-method-conda-install
